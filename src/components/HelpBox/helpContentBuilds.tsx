      <b>RV (Roll Value)</b> is a metric that can be used to rate or sort
      (soonâ„¢) artifact and build substats. Genshin Optimizer describes RV as
      follows: "
      <i>
        The Roll Value (RV) of a substat is a percentage of the current value
        over the highest potential 5 value

      ".

      For example a HP% roll of 5.3% equals to 90% RV. That is because maximum
